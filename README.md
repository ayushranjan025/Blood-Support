# What is Blood-Support?

Help the blood banks to gather donors more easily. Through our website, donors are able to see nearby blood banks and can donate at any of the blood bank according to their preferences. Also, donors can see the most required blood group under the blood Banks‚Äôs information, so that the donor can reach out to that blood bank where the blood is required in emergency. After each donation, donor will be rewarded with points on his/her portal, which will engage our users.

It also help hospitals and maternity centers to get the blood immediately at the time of emergency. Through our website, hospital and maternity centers are able to see nearby blood banks and donors can easily request any of the blood bank or donor according to their preference (required blood group).

## What problem Blood-Support solving?

![SDG3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52650290/192115074-4b37f844-d487-49c7-9f92-4cb5553872b4.jpg)

We are trying to help United Nations to achieve this goal by 2030, to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births & to achieve universal health coverage, including safe, effective, & quality access to health-care services.

In many cities of our country(Pakistan), mostly, blood banks are not available at nearby hospitals. & this causes delay in the patients‚Äô blood transfusion procedure. When hospitals request blood from blood banks, it takes a lot of time, & sometimes that blood group is not available. Many patients lose their lives because they do not get blood at a moment of emergency.
